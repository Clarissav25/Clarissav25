# Hello World

### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorites because it was an introduction to the class and labs. This lab allowed me to get familiar with systems like Linux and Github. The lab contained useful information that made it easy to navigate through the program. By the end of  lab 1, I was able to add a header, change the message, and commit my program.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was my first time filtering a vector in a lab. The lab contained useful information which allowed me to create two functions that were used to filter the vector in the main function. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was my first time creating a program that has a three loop pattern. I was able to use my knowledge on loops that were given in class and my homework to create a pattern that had at least one loop in it. 

I love Computer Science!
